#+title: Readme

Setup a new machine using GNU Stow, Nix (nix-darwin on mac), and scripting.

* Philosophy

We want to have an entirely reproducible system across whatever underlying OS, so Nix and stow create a method for performing this setup

* Installation:
** Install nix:
#+begin_src bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
#+end_src

We will create setup scripts for the OS's we use (unix based)

* Installation scripts:
** Mac
** Linux
   
** NixOS:
Run nixos-config.sh:

I have this aliased in my .zshrc to ~nrs~ for "nix rebuild switch"

#+begin_src bash
#!/bin/bash
# Save as ~/Dotfiles/scripts/nixos-config.sh

# Copy configs to system location
sudo cp -r ~/Dotfiles/nixos/* /etc/nixos/

# Optionally rebuild
read -p "Rebuild NixOS now? (y/n): " answer
if [[ $answer == "y" ]]; then
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch
fi
#+end_src
